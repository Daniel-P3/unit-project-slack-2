#Online-Chatroom

##Goal
So we now know how to make a GET request to retrieve data from a server. However, it is also essential to be able to input data to the server.

In this challenge, we will be creating a messaging app. We will then add that room chatroom to our calendar so that we can communicate with everybody in our cohort.


##How do I get started
1. Create a chatroom element using html and javascript (feel free to use jQuery).
  - Create an area where incoming messages are displayed
  - Create an input and button where your messages can be sent

2. To retrieve and input messages from the server, make GET and POST requests to the following endpoint:
````
https://popping-fire-8919.firebaseio.com/Chatroom
````

3. Integrate the chatroom with your calendar app.
